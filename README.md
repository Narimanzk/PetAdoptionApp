An application that allows users to put animals up for adoption and apply to adopt an animal. The user type includes RegularUser and PetShelter. A regular user has the ability to put animals up for adoption, apply for adoption, and ask questions in the forum. Like a regular user, the shelter is can put animals up for adoption. However, it can also accept donations from regular users. Both user types can respond to questions.
