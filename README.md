# Pet-Adoption-App (Group 5)
Welcome to group 5's Pet Adoption App repo!

## Project Description
Our group is creating an application that could be used by a pet shelter to manage the adoption process for its customers. Once a customer has created a profile, they are able to put a pet up for adoption, apply to adopt a pet, or ask a question on an online forum. The pet shelter is also able to put pets up for adoption, however they can also answer questions that were posted by other users. In addition, a user can choose to donate to the pet shelter.

We will be creating a back end that will support this whole process, as well as a front end that users will interact with. In addition, we will be creating an Android app that will perform some (but not all) actions they can do on the web application.
